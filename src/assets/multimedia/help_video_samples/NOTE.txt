These help videos are samples only. The final videos will be produced once the app is finished.

The help videos do not include descriptions or in-video labels because they will be placed as looping videos next to explanatory blocks of text.


I cannot yet implement the other help video samples because I have not programmed the necessary functionality. These include undo-redo help, tab switching help, and saving help.
